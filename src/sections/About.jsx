  const story = `Iâ€™ve always liked psychology and art, and wanted to explore them through tech. 
I started with HCI and worked as a software engineer. On the side, I learned VR and enjoyed the possibility of immersive expression.
Now I'm back in school, researching in CogAI and NeuroAI.

In my free hours, I mostly zoom out, sometimes play the piano, paint and take photos.
